# Virtual patient simulator for skill training in dentistry
___
### Introduction

  As medical procedures continue to grow more intricate and healthcare education demands increase, it's essential to identify effective and resource-efficient training methods. This is particularly significant in dentistry, a field requiring high skill levels in precise, hands-on procedures. The recent pandemic highlighted the need for innovative skill training approaches for both dental students and experienced professionals. Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is widely accepted but requires considerable tutor attention per student, which often isn't feasible due to resource constraints and limited faculty availability.

The escalating costs and complexities of clinical training also pose challenges, with the development of clinical simulators often incurring high costs due to the need for realistic 3D graphical interfaces, user interfaces, physical simulation models, and device event handling. The field of dentistry uniquely relies on tactile sensation, and the underutilization of haptics in dental simulators prevents the provision of comprehensive, realistic training experiences.

Therefore, there's an urgent need for a comprehensive, cost-effective solution that delivers realistic, efficient training for dental students. Such a solution should utilize technological advancements to enhance traditional education, streamline clinical simulator development, and incorporate haptic feedback to ensure training authenticity. The creation of a Virtual Patient Simulator for dentistry could potentially address these challenges, enabling self-paced, self-directed learning for students and simulating real-life clinical scenarios for a wide range of actions. This innovation would foster diagnostic reasoning and comprehensive patient management, allowing students to practice treatment strategies on a virtual patient before real-life implementation.
